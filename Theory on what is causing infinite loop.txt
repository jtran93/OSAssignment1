A core request for a process is completed with no processes in the queues.
This causes all cores to be free and DISK and IO just happen to be free at this point.
The process' next request is END, so program goes through termination routine (printing data, removing process, etc.).
Next request is never grabbed causing all *LOW* values to be equal, hence the loop.

Possibilities
	-Qs are not implmented correctly
	-Termination routine is not implemented correctly
	
What to do
	-Trace the code with the input values

When testing for prioirty of process to determine whether it goes to HighQ or LowQ,
there was a typo. "Low" was entered " Low"
